## Code Style

Write clean, elegant code using the fewest lines possible while maintaining readability. Follow these principles:

- **Conciseness**: Prefer compact, expressive code over verbose implementations
- **Clarity**: Code should be self-documenting and easy to understand
- **SOLID Principles**: Apply where applicable:
  - Single Responsibility: Each function/class should have one clear purpose
  - Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
  - Liskov Substitution: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
  - Interface Segregation: Depend on abstractions, not concretions
  - Dependency Inversion: High-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level modules
- **Functional Programming**: Favor immutability, pure functions, and declarative patterns
- **Modern Language Features**: Use latest syntax and features when they improve code quality
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Avoid unnecessary libraries and frameworks
- **Performance**: Write efficient code that scales well
